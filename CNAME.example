# CNAME Configuration for Custom Domain
# 
# If you want to use a custom domain (e.g., stockcryptoalarm.com)
# instead of yourusername.github.io/LPmonitix/:
#
# 1. Uncomment the line below and replace with your domain
# 2. Configure your DNS provider to point to GitHub Pages:
#    - Add an A record pointing to: 185.199.108.153
#    - Add an A record pointing to: 185.199.109.153
#    - Add an A record pointing to: 185.199.110.153
#    - Add an A record pointing to: 185.199.111.153
#    OR
#    - Add a CNAME record pointing to: yourusername.github.io
#
# 3. In your GitHub repository:
#    - Go to Settings → Pages
#    - Enter your custom domain
#    - Enable "Enforce HTTPS" (after DNS propagates)
#
# Example:
# stockcryptoalarm.com
#
# Then rename this file to just "CNAME" (without .example extension)
